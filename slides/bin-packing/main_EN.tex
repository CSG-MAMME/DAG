    \begin{block}{Problem Statement}
        Suppose we have $n$ objects, each of a given size, and some bins of equal capacity. We want to assign the objects tot he bins using as few bins as possible. Of course the total size of the objects assigned to one bin should not exceed its capacity.$[1]$

    \begin{alertblock}{Complexity and Applications}
        The Bin Packing decision problem is \textbf{NP-complete}. The formulation is applicable to a variety of real-world problems and admits several reformulations.
    \end{alertblock}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Online bin packing.
        \item Filling up trucks in a logistics environment.
        \item Creating file backups in media.
        \item Knapsack problem (one bin and each item has cost and value).
        \item Virtual Machine placement in a data center.

    \vspace{-10pt}

    Given a set of bins $S_1, S_2, \dots$ with the same size $V$ and a list of $n$ items with sizes $a_1, \dots, a_n$ to pack,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{minimize } & B = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} y_i \\
            \text{subject to } & B \geq 1 \\
            & \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n}a_jx_{ij} \leq V y_i, \quad \quad \forall i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n\rbrace \\
            & \sum_{i = 1}^n x_{ij} = 1 \qquad \qquad x_{ij}, y_i \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace \\
            %& x_i \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    \hspace{20pt} where $y_i = 1$ if bin $S_i$ is used and $x_{ij} = 1$ if item $a_j$ is put into bin $S_i$.
