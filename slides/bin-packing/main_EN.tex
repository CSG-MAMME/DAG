    \begin{block}{Problem Statement}
        Suppose we have $n$ objects, each of a given size, and some bins of equal capacity. We want to assign the objects tot he bins using as few bins as possible. Of course the total size of the objects assigned to one bin should not exceed its capacity.$[1]$

    \vspace{-10pt}

    Given a set of bins $S_1, S_2, \dots$ with the same size $V$ and a list of $n$ items with sizes $a_1, \dots, a_n$ to pack,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{minimize } & B = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} y_i \\
            \text{subject to } & B \geq 1 \\
            & \sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n}a_jx_{ij} \leq V y_i, \quad \quad \forall i \in \lbrace 1, \dots, n\rbrace \\
            & \sum_{i = 1}^n x_{ij} = 1 \qquad \qquad x_{ij}, y_i \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace \\
            %& x_i \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}
    \hspace{20pt} where $y_i = 1$ if bin $S_i$ is used and $x_{ij} = 1$ if item $a_j$ is put into bin $S_i$.
